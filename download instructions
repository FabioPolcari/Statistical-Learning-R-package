The code needed for the package installation include the R scripts package_creation.R, class_regr.R and clustering.R.

The first one contains the code for the creation of the whole package, while the last two are the scripts containing the functions.

1. The first step is to open package creation.R, install the needed libraries specified in the comments and upload them into the working space.
2. Then write a valid address in the path_to_package. This will be the path used by the system for creating the package.
3. Then execute create_package command. The system will create a folder called “StatLearning” at the path previously specified.
4. Open this folder and find an other one called R. Open it.
5. Then put clustering.R and class_regr.R into this folder.
6. Then execute the three following commands.
7. devtools::document create a the documentation of the functions.
8. devtools::check check if everything is corrected.
9. devtools::install actually install the package on the computer.

roxygenise command will be needed to save changes to the functions.

10. The last step is to upload the package in the workin space with library(StatLearning).
